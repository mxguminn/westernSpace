# Summer Research

a complimation of code that I wrote this summer~

#### AGN_dispersion.ipynb

<b>AGN_dispersion.ipynb</b> is a program from ETC_grism, modified to allow for the dispersion of multiple point sources (AGN). This program was originally developed for CASTOR, a proposed Canadian, UV, U, and G band space telescope. However this program would not be useful using real data because CASTOR is slitless, making dispersing <i>all</i> the light that comes through pointless. It is still a cool program though!  


#### learning.ipynb

<b>learning.ipynb</b>, <i>which i will rename,</i>  is a program used to generate fake spectra emission lines, specifically AGN emission lines.
